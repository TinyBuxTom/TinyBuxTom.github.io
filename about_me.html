                Hi, I am Tom van Pelt. An enthusiastic student of Computer Engineering at the Hogeschool Rotterdam. 
                I have been busy with everything that has to do with computers for almost my entire life. 
                From testing with Arduino's to a complete registration system for the RDM. I continue where others stop. <br>
                I like to work alone, but can also easily work in a team. Working with Scrum is no problem for me.
                <br> <br>
                In my free time I like to listen to music and watch films and series. 
                I also often do odd jobs around the house and with family and friends. 
                I have done a number of electrical and carpentry jobs, such as building a small electrical network and making my own furniture. 
                <br> <br>
                So if you are interested and you are looking for an enthusiastic and motivated intern, please contact me.
            </p>
